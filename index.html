        <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
        <p>Concept: <br>In this narrative, you will take the perspective of an intern at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, which is a fictional paper and office supply sales company featured in the American television series The Office (my favorite show). You arrive at the office thinking that it's just another normal day, but something seems off... By exploring the different parts of the office, you will be able to find out what's happening! If you have watched the show, you will be able to understand some of the inside jokes. This was a very fun project to make and I hope you'll like it too!</p>

    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <h2>Reading 1</h2>
    <p>It was very interesting to learn about the gender imbalance within the field of computer art and, more specifically, the incredible women who have been contributing to the fields of computer and digital art for a long time. I was very happy to learn that the early years of electronic computing was very receptive to female labour in programming — before reading this article, I would have thought that there would have been more pushback towards women working in computer programming, similar to what has happened in the past with other technical professions. I also really liked reading about Lilian Shwartz who argued that computer art humbles artists in the sense that it creates another dimension to the created content by processing information, obeying rules, and learning by experience. Consequently, computer art adds a lot more freedom to the mediums created by artists!</p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        Will the rise of NFTs expand the field of computer art? How will that impact artists? Will artists feel the need to engage with digital art in order to remain relevant in the future?<br>
        Why was the role of programming more receptive towards women in the early years of electronic computing when compared to other technical professions? <br>
        Given that all technological artifacts are inherently political, how can we continue pushing towards more inclusivity and accessibility within the field of computer art?</p>
    <h2>Reading 2</h2>
    <p>Wow, this week's reading was very interesting and eye-opening. American Artist has provided us with a powerful reflection on the history of computer technology through the lens of Blackness. The artist argues that the development of gooey had the intention of making computers more accessible to the users, yet, by doing so, has defined the user as being White and suppressed the Black community. American Artist proposes the return to the black interface in our contemporary computers in order to remove the user and/or programmer subjection. This reading made me think about Langdon Winner's article "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" in which he argues that technological artifacts have political and social power and, thus, are able to empower and disempower specific individuals and groups in our society. </p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        Can you think of any other technological artifact that has represented a specific group of people while suppressing another?<br>
        Are you convinced by the inclusion initiatives and new hiring practices of Silicon Valley's companies? <br>
        How can we, as users of technology, act on the issue proposed by American Artist?
    </p>
    <h2>Reading 3</h2>
    <p>In this week's reading, Jenny Odell provides a subtle critique to the lack of "randomness" in the current digital world. She talks about her past interaction with the internet and how it allowed her to experience chance encounters with random people and content. With the rise of data mining and targeted advertising, we are likely to travel to the same places and see the same content on the internet every day. It is possible to argue that these new technologies are mainly empowering the private sector by encouraging us to purchase the content that we are constantly seeing on our screens. This article can be connected to the idea proposed by our Professor in the recorded lecture that the internet nowadays is mainly serving a specific group of people and, more specifically, their interest for profit.</p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        In the recorded lecture, our Professor talks about the responsibility we have as users, designers and creators in the digital world. How do you think this responsibility is manifested during our daily usage of the internet?<br>
        In the recorded lecture, our Professor also mentions the monopoly that tech giants have over the internet. It is argued that the web should empower people, and not the few companies who own the technology. What do you think about the concept of decentralizing the internet? <br>
        As we learnt from the recorded lecture, the internet may seem invisible, but there is a huge infrastructure involved to make it functional. How has the development of the internet impacted the environment?
    </p>
    <h2>Reading 4</h2>
    <p>In this talk, Lauren McCarthy talks about a series of projects she created/participated in that explore our relationship with technology and surveillance. I was particularly interested in the project "Someone" where a group of people took the role of the smart home devices that we use nowadays and remotely watched over a home 24 hours a day, responding to residents' questions. I wonder how challenging it must have been for Lauren and her team to pursue this project, as they had to adjust their entire routines and schedules to be able to assist individuals 24/7. This project reminded me of a design method called Wizard of Oz prototyping used by designers to test features of a product. They assume the role played by Lauren and her team in "Someone," and encourage the users to think that the feature being tested is computer-driven, when in fact it is being controlled by humans. </p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        In the era of constant surveillance that we live in, who are the people who do not have the privilege of hiding/not being seen just because of who they are or what they look like?<br>
        After listening to Lauren's talk, do you still feel comfortable about using smart home devices and letting this technology "invade" your home and privacy?<br>
        Do you think the "metaverse" will increase the idea of having two separate lives, one in the virtual world and another in the real world?
    </p>
    <h2>Reading 5</h2>
    <p>In this week's reading, we learnt about what a poor image is and how it impacts our society and economy. It was very interesting to learn about Hito's perspective on low resolution images, and how the idea of focus is a class position of privilege, while being out of focus lowers one's value as an image. This week I'll be presenting on the artist Rosa Menkman who has a lot of ideas regarding Resolution Theory. Hito further emphasizes the lower value of poor images in "the class society of images" when arguing that their status as illicit or degraded grants stop them from being assigned any value. The author also argues that poor images are basically popular images, because they can be made and seen by the masses, and follows by arguing that this type of images should be assigned the values of velocity, intensity and spread. </p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        Do you consider memes an example of poor images?
        <br>
        Can you think of any effects that generate "poor images" (think about effects like blurring, glitching, pixelating)?
        <br>
        When do you purposefully apply these types of effects to your work?
    </p>
    <h2>Reading 6</h2>
    <p>In this TED talk, Joy Buolamwini talks about the issue of algorithmic bias, more specifically the trend of racial discrimination arising from the adoption of facial recognition technology. She argues that the reason her face is not recognized when using this technology is that the “training set” on which the facial recognition program is based is not representative. This means that there is an opportunity to change this by encouraging more inclusive code: having full spectrum teams of diverse individuals (WHO), factoring fairness as we develop systems (HOW), and making social change a priority instead of an after-thought while creating these systems (WHY). This TED talk reminded me of the USC Center for AI in Society (where I work!) and the work they have done in ensuring fairness and equity in AI. </p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        As algorithms take over more and more aspects of our lives, what types of regulations do you expect to see in the near future?
        <br>
        Can you think of any other examples of technology that present algorithmic bias?
        <br>
        Do you think major tech companies are following the guidelines that Joy presented for inclusive code?
    </p>
    <h2>Reading 7</h2>
    <p>Olivia Ross provides readers with a series of insightful questions that will definitely help us, as students, to refine our work. I was particularly interested in how Olivia was able to separate the questions into categories that tied them together in a specific way of honoring nonviolent creative code. Chimamanda Adichie's TED talk was very inspiring as well. I was able to relate to her story when she was talking about how her college roommate had an erroneous image and understanding of Chimamanda's culture and home country from popular culture and "single stories". I'm from Brazil, and a lot of people in the U.S. immediately associate my culture to soccer, carnaval, and attractive women. </p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        Whose bodies have contributed to your work? How are those bodies visible or invisible?
        <br>
        Consider the materiality of the server, the data center, the cable, the rare-earth mineral mine, the factory, the oil field, the air conditioner, and the other things that are holding up this practice. Where can you decouple those links? <br>
        Does your project use design patterns that mirror cycles of addiction (e.g copying the slot-machine)? How can it promote healthy, balanced relationships with technology?
    </p>
    <h2>Reading 8</h2>
    <p>When talking about her project "Building a Museum 353 years into the future", Ari Melenciano explains the goal of this exploration which is embracing the moment and creating a space where black people will not be thinking about using artistic practices for activist purposes, instead they will be allowed to be human beings who are able to create beyond their social identity, similar to what other communities do. I thought that was a very interesting project! Ari also argues that the term "user" when talking about design is not empowering, and she prefers to refer to the people we are trying to serve as "intended beneficiary." This was an insight that I never really thought about before, and I think I'm going to adopt her term!</p>
    <p>Questions: <br>
        Why do you believe the term "user" is not empowering/positive?

        <br>
        What does Ari mean when she says "We need to design with people, and not only for them"?
        <br>
        What are your thoughts on ecologically-centered design?
