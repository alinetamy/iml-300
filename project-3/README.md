What?
    This project is meant to spread awareness about eating disorders, which have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. Eating disorders are serious but treatable mental and physical illnesses that can affect people of all genders, ages, races, religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations, body shapes, and weights. National surveys estimate that 20 million women and 10 million men in America will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives. While no one knows for sure what causes eating disorders, a growing consensus suggests that it is a range of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors.
    
Why?
    There are many myths about what causes eating disorders, how serious they are, and who develops an eating disorder. For this reason, it is important to make people aware of the facts associated with this mental illness.
    
Who?
     Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating disorder. Familiarity with eating disorders can lead to increased consciousness and empathy for those who are suffering or struggling while decreasing the stigma often associated with these mental illnesses. 
     
How?
    Taking a social justice perspective on eating disorders means pointing out that people with eating disorders face many stereotypes and stigmas in general, which might be made worse if they do not fit the “expected picture” of what someone with an eating disorder looks or acts like. It also help us to move beyond simplistic perspectives on eating disorders that present them as issues of personal choice or vanity.
