Dieting is also associated with other health concerns including depression, anxiety nutritional and metabolic problems, and, contrary to expectation, with an increase in weight.

                        Many people are exposed to the media on a daily basis, but only a small percentage of them develop eating disorders. Eating disorders are complex and serious illnesses that have biological, genetic and psychological roots. The media can certainly impact how a person feels about their looks, but it does not cause eating disorders.</center>
