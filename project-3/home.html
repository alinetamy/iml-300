                </h3>
                <p>
                    these are not monsters. there are no monsters here.<br>
                    these feel like love, and when they creep inside you<br>
                    it’s like something once missing is finally coming home.<br>
                    how could a monster make such pretty girls?<br>
                    pretty girls,<br>
                    pretty skinny girls,<br>
                    they look like everything<br>
                    that is wonderful about being alive,<br>
                    like vodka diet cokes<br>
                    and pictures of hip bones at the beach<br>
                    and all i’ve eaten for the past three days is my own fingernails<br>
                    and these monsters (not monsters)<br>
                    can make you pretty too.</p>
                <p>
                    you’ll learn to make jokes about why you’re slicing<br>
                    the five strawberries you brought for lunch<br>
                    (and breakfast, and dinner)<br>
                    into twenty-five pieces.<br>
                    lifting the morsels from perfectly<br>
                    folded napkin with delicate crackling fingers<br>
                    to hesitant tongue<br>
                    and when the jokes get too cumbersome,<br>
                    and taste too much like nourishment,<br>
                    like letting go, like happiness,<br>
                    learn to put an end to lunch,<br>
                    forget what it means and<br>
                    by the end of your last year of high school<br>
                    you’ll know every spot in the building<br>
                    where no one will ask where your friends are<br>
                    and why you look so tired.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    the monsters (not monsters)<br>
                    will share their secrets.<br>
                    you’ll learn that needle-thin bones, when crushed<br>
                    into a fine paste and stirred into<br>
                    the twenty glasses of water you were going to drink today<br>
                    taste like lemonade<br>
                    and you can have a sip<br>
                    for only the cost of the rest of your life spent worshiping<br>
                    the feeling of hollow<br>
                    searching up number and number<br>
                    and dead girl and number<br>
                    you, too, can spend the rest<br>
                    of the day smelling of what<br>
                    you just had to scrub off the
                    bathroom floor.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    go, they’ll say,<br>
                    outstretching manicured hands, bottle cap wrists—<br>
                    memorize menus and all the lies you could tell<br>
                    spend hours at the grocery store counting<br>
                    fifty<br>
                    one hundred<br>
                    two hundred<br>
                    no more than three<br>
                    or else suddenly your thighs begin to inflate like the balloons<br>
                    from all the birthday parties you couldn’t go to<br>
                    you will learn to avoid celebration<br>
                    because celebration means food<br>
                    you will spend christmas day<br>
                    fanaticizing about burying<br>
                    your dissolving teeth into your knuckles<br>
                    until your heart stops.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    the not-monsters<br>
                    will feed you your first cigarette<br>
                    and your second, and your tenth.<br>
                    they will leave your once shiny hair<br>
                    in a clump<br>
                    on your pillowcase, just for you.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    and when your body gets too weak,<br>
                    it starts to crumble,<br>
                    but where sick breaks skin<br>
                    sunflowers will grow.<br>
                    an entire garden will force<br>
                    itself from your empty stomach<br>
                    billowing out your mouth and you’ll choke<br>
                    but you’ll be happy<br>
                    because at least you’re not eating<br>
                    you’ll decompose<br>
                    until you cannot be differentiated<br>
                    from all the skeletons that have been<br>
                    living in your closet<br>
                    don’t you wish you could shrink<br>
                    don’t you wish you could have that control<br>
                    don’t you wish you could make your mom cry<br>
                    because she just doesn’t get why you’d do this<br>
                    you don’t get why you’d do this<br>
                    you’re smart but you just googled<br>
                    how many calories are in tooth paste<br>
                    the pretty girls<br>
                    pretty skinny girls<br>
                    pretty skinny girls<br>
                    pretty dying girls<br>
                    pretty dead girls<br>
                    the parasite can be restrained but not destroyed.<br>
                    but no matter.<br>
                    it’s a beautiful thing to be made of porcelain.<br>
                    the picture of your hip bones at the beach was worth it.<br>
                </p>
